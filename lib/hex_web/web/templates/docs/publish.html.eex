<h2>
  Publishing a package
</h2>
<p>
  Publishing a package to Hex consists of registering a Hex user, adding metadata to the project's <code>mix.exs</code> file, and finally submitting the package with a <code>mix</code> task.
</p>

<h3>Registering a Hex user</h3>

<p>
  When registering a user, you will be prompted for a username, your email and a password. The email is used to confirm your identity during signup, as well as to contact you in case there is an issue with one of your packages. The email will never be shared with a third party.
</p>

<pre><code class="nohighlight">$ mix hex.user register
Username: johndoe
Email: john.doe@example.com
Password:
Password (confirm):
Registering...
Generating API key...
You are required to confirm your email to access your account, a confirmation email has been sent to john.doe@example.com
</code></pre>

<p>
  Once this step has been completed, check your email inbox for the confirmation email. Once you have followed the enclosed link, your account will be ready to use.
</p>

<h3>Naming your package</h3>

<p>
  Before publishing, you will have to choose the name of your package. Remember that packages published to Hex are public and can be accessed by anyone in the community. It is also the responsibility of the community to pick and encourage good package names. Here are some tips:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid using offensive or harassing package names, nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.</li>
  <li>If you are providing functionality on top of an existing package, consider using that package name as a prefix. For example, if you want to add authentication to <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug">Plug</a>, consider calling your package <code>plug_auth</code> (or <code>plug_somename</code>) instead of <code>auth</code> (or <code>somename</code>).</li>
  <li>Avoid namespace conflicts with existing packages. Plug owns the <code>Plug</code> namespace, if you have an authentication package for Plug use the namespace <code>PlugAuth</code> instead of <code>Plug.Auth</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  With a name in hand, it is time to add the proper metadata to your <code>mix.exs</code> file.
</p>

<h3>Adding metadata to <code>mix.exs</code></h3>

<p>
  The package is configured in the <code>project</code> function in the project's <code>mix.exs</code> file. <a href="#example-mix-exs-file">See below</a> for an example file.
</p>

<p>
  First, make sure that the <code>:version</code> property is correct. All Hex packages are required to follow <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Fill in the <code>:description</code> property. It should be a sentence, or a few sentences, describing the package.
</p>

<p>
  Under the <code>:package</code> property are some additional configuration options:
</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt><code>:licenses</code></dt>
  <dd>A list of licences the project is licensed under. This attribute is required.</dd>
  <dt><code>:name</code></dt>
  <dd>The name of the package in case you want to publish the package with a different name than the application name.</dd>
  <dt><code>:maintainers</code></dt>
  <dd>A list of names (and/or emails) of maintainers to the project. Optional but highly recommended.</dd>
  <dt><code>:links</code></dt>
  <dd>A map where the key is a link name and the value is the link URL. Optional but highly recommended.</dd>
  <dt><code>:files</code></dt>
  <dd>A list of files and directories to include in the package. Has to include <code>mix.exs</code>. Defaults to standard project directories, so you usually don't need to set this property.</dd>
  <dt><code>:build_tools</code></dt>
  <dd>List of build tools that can build the package. It's very rare that you need to set this, as Hex tries to automatically detect the build tools based on the files in the package. If a "rebar" or "rebar.config" file is present Hex will mark it as able to build with rebar. This detection can be overridden by setting this field.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Dependencies</h4>

<p>
  A dependency defined with no SCM (<code>:git</code> or <code>:path</code>) will be automatically treated as a Hex dependency. See the <a href="/docs/usage">Usage guide</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
  Only Hex packages will be included as dependencies of the package, for example Git dependencies will not be included. Additionally, only production dependencies will be included, just like how Mix will only fetch production dependencies when fetching the dependencies of your dependencies. Dependencies will be treated as production dependencies when they are defined with no <code>:only</code> property or with <code>only: :prod</code>.

<h4>Example mix.exs file</h4>

<pre><code class="elixir">defmodule Postgrex.Mixfile do
  use Mix.Project

  def project do
    [app: :postgrex,
     version: "0.1.0",
     elixir: "0.13.0",
     build_embedded: Mix.env == :prod,
     start_permanent: Mix.env == :prod,
     description: description(),
     package: package(),
     deps: deps()]
  end

  def application do
    []
  end

  defp deps do
    [{:decimal, "~> 0.2.0",
      :ex_doc, github: "elixir-lang/ex_doc"}]
  end

  defp description do
    """
    A few sentences (a paragraph) describing the project.
    """
  end

  defp package do
    [# These are the default files included in the package
     name: :postgrex,
     files: ["lib", "priv", "mix.exs", "README*", "readme*", "LICENSE*", "license*"],
     maintainers: ["Eric Meadows-Jönsson", "José Valim"],
     licenses: ["Apache 2.0"],
     links: %{"GitHub" => "https://github.com/ericmj/postgrex",
              "Docs" => "http://ericmj.github.io/postgrex/"}]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h3>Submitting the package</h3>

<p>
  After the package metadata and dependencies have been added to <code>mix.exs</code>, we are ready to publish the package with the <code>mix hex.publish</code> command:
</p>

<pre><code class="nohighlight">$ mix hex.publish
Publishing postgrex v0.4.0
  Dependencies:
    decimal ~> 0.1.0
  Excluded dependencies (not part of the Hex package):
    ex_doc
  Included files:
    lib/postgrex
    lib/postgrex/binary_utils.ex
    lib/postgrex/connection.ex
    lib/postgrex/protocol.ex
    lib/postgrex/records.ex
    lib/postgrex/types.ex
    mix.exs
Proceed? [Yn] Y
Published postgrex v0.4.0
</code></pre>

<p>
  Congratulations, you've published your package! It will appear on the <a href="https://hex.pm/">https://hex.pm</a> site and will be available to add as a dependency in other Mix projects.
</p>

<p>
  Please test your package after publishing by adding it as dependency to a Mix project and fetching and compiling it. If there are any issues, you can publish the package again for up to one hour after first publication. A publication can also be reverted with <code>mix hex.publish --revert VERSION</code>.
</p>

<p>
  When running the command to publish a package, Hex will create a tar file of all the files and directories listed in the <code>:files</code> property. When the tarball has been pushed to the Hex servers, it will be uploaded to a CDN for fast and reliable access for users. Hex will also recompile the registry file that all clients will update automatically when fetching dependencies.
</p>
